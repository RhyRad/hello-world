# hello-world

Hi! I am a software engineer at Liberty Mutual Insurance. I love spending time with family and friends.  I enjoy doing anything active.  I belong to an amazing community involving my running club and gym. I am an avid runner/soccer player. I am an alum of UNH where I played soccer as well. I am excited to take this course and to meet the people that are the same journey.
